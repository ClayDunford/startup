## Initial Setup
I think using git will become very helpful, but defintiely does not feel initially very intuitive

My general startup ideas:


### Idea 1: Succulents
Succulent window that grows at a realistic speed. Tracks weather based on your location. Maybe uses google maps to create a realistic window scene? (likely needs more functionality) It would be cool to combine it with a productivity system ala forest? Maybe connect it with the atomic habits system?

if atomic habits, once a habit reaches "maturity" you can "propogate it" by stacking another habit on top of it. 

Multiple people can do it together to form accountability? "Hey it looks like such and such person's plant is wilting, send them a message to encourage them"

### Idea 2: Class flow visualizer
Creates a my map class planner, but that shows dependencies based on the pre-reqs. Clearly and simply visualizes the flow, and has a simple visual editor. 

### Idea 3: C is for Cookie
Illustrates how many cookies are currently tracking you in a fun visual way. Maybe a score based on how many cookies you have? (Raw (less) to burnt (tons)
