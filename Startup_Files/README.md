[My Notes](notes.md)

A tool to show the dependencies between various classes when planning multiple semesters out and displays the flow between classes like a flowchart.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Mymap is a great tool for planning classes, but often falls short when you try to move classes around, as it's difficult to track which classes require or are themselves prequisites. This can make planning, especially when creating a multi-year plan difficult. This website intends to be a tool to clearly visualize how your classes flow together, so when you switch one class, you have an understanding of how that affects the other classes you're planning on taking.

### Design

<img width="568" height="452" alt="Design Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bede04f6-cff2-4ad8-a2aa-138ddce45283" />

Simple minimalist design. Centered primarily on displaying the class visualization and letting the user move various classes (here represented by rectangle with rounded corners) around. Each class will be clickable and display information about the class below the editor, as well as highlighting the various classes that connect with this one. The actual classplan itself will be stored in a simple custom data structure, akin to a double linked list. The webapp will then read that data structure to know how to generate the visual of the class plan.

### Key features

- Visual editor to illustrate the connections between classes like a flowchart
- Login feature so users can save their current plans and make new ones
- Export button that lets the user export the currently displayed plan and save it to their computer

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Used to build the structure and skeleton of the website
- **CSS** - Add color and visuals to the site to make it easier to navigate
- **React** - Used to create the visual editor to modify the class structure.
- **Service** - Saves the user's class plans so they can access it at later times. If it isn't too complex, using web services to access the BYU course catalog to dynamically generate the class connections
- **DB/Login** - Each user creates a login to save their plan, which is stored in a database server.
- **WebSocket** - Used to autosave each change the user makes to their plan without having to do anything manually. Automatically highlights when the user has made a change that invalidates their course plan.
